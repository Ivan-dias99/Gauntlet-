# RUBERRA — REPO SELF-KNOWLEDGE
**Living document. Updated at each major frontier advance.**
**Read this before any session. It tells you where reality is.**

## WHAT RUBERRA IS

A sovereign mission operating system. Not a SaaS dashboard. Not a generic AI wrapper. Not a chat product with plugins.

The core unit is the **mission**. Every run, every output, every decision is bound to a mission.

Four sovereign organs: **Lab** (investigate) · **School** (learn) · **Creation** (build) · **Profile** (govern).

## CURRENT SOVEREIGN FRONTIER

**Active Stack: 06**
Stack 1 (Canon + Sovereignty): CLOSED
Stack 2 (Mission Substrate): CLOSED
Stack 3 (Sovereign Intelligence): CLOSED 2026-04-02
Stack 4 (Autonomous Operations): CLOSED 2026-04-02
Stack 5 (Adaptive Experience): CLOSED 2026-04-02

Stack 3 closure (2026-04-02):
- `resolveMissionRoute()` called at every dispatch when mission active.
- Mission pioneer stack honored: `activeMission.workflow.pioneerStack[0]` as `preferredPioneerId`.
- `routeDigest` mission-bound: `[contract] · [mission name] · [missionReason]`.
- `buildMissionSystemContext()` — mission identity (name, objective, scope, notThis, chamber, success criteria) injected as system[0].
- `buildMissionMemoryContext()` — prior mission continuity items (last 4, filtered by mission ID/name) injected alongside identity.
- Intelligence now serves mission identity AND mission memory — not generic session.
- detectPatterns ingests signals + continuity events (mission-linked via workflowId/title).

Stack 4 closure (2026-04-02 — real):
- Pre-dispatch: `createTask()` → `transitionTask("in_progress")` BEFORE execution starts.
- Pre-dispatch: `createOperationFlow()` + `advanceFlow()` — OperationFlow in "running" state at dispatch.
- Pre-dispatch: `evaluateApprovalTrigger("external_effect", policy)` — approval gate evaluated for connector actions; `escalate_sovereign` creates real `ApprovalRequest`.
- Pre-dispatch: `generatedMissionTaskRef.current.add(assistantId)` — deduplication, prevents useEffect double-emit.
- Post-dispatch (finally): `transitionTask(t, "completed"|"failed", {outputDigest})` — real lifecycle close.
- Post-dispatch (finally): `advanceFlow(advanceFlow(flow))` — Execute + Settle steps done → flow "complete".
- Post-dispatch (finally): `emitSignal()` — `task_complete` MissionSignal from real runtime event with content digest.
- Post-dispatch (finally): `RunObservation` appended with pioneerId + digest.
- Mutations: signal dismiss + approval approve/reject — all real setActiveMissionOps mutations.
- `MissionOperationsPanel` wired with real callbacks.

Stack 5 closure (2026-04-02):
- `setMissionState("blocked")` injects `unexpected_state` anomaly into SystemModel → SystemHealthBand renders organically at "degraded" health.
- `setMissionState("idle"/"running")` resolves mission-blocked anomaly — health recovers.
- Mission ledger → awareness sync effect: `useEffect` on `activeMission.ledger.currentState` calls `setMissionState` — ledger transitions propagate to SystemModel outside dispatch cycle.
- Terminal mission dispatch gate: `handleSend` checks `ledger.currentState === "completed" | "archived"` → pushes critical recommendation signal + returns early. No execution on terminal missions.
- Ghost-safe activation: `handleMissionActivate` aborts all in-flight requests + resets loading/signals before binding new mission.
- `ChamberChat` receives `missionStatus` prop — terminal states render consequence notice bar + lock composer textarea.
- `missionStatus` threaded: App.tsx → LabMode / SchoolMode / CreationMode → ChamberChat.

## WHAT IS REAL (VERIFIED LIVE)

### Execution core
- `App.tsx` — ~1630 lines. Shell-level owner of all state. Routing, execution, MCP, mission, governance gate all here.
- `runtime-fabric.ts` — single persisted authority for continuity, signals, connectors, intelligence, workspace.
- `routing-contracts.ts` — real route resolution: resolveRoute() → leads pioneer selection → feeds leadPioneerId into trace.
- `pioneer-registry.ts` — 7 pioneers typed with home_chamber, allowed_crossings, model_family, strengths.
- `model-orchestration.ts` — MODEL_REGISTRY with provider/tier/task mapping.
- Every chat dispatch goes through: `resolveRouteDecision → resolveRoute → execution → trace → surface`.
- **Stack 03 CLOSED**: dispatch when mission active: `resolveRouteDecision (pioneer from mission.workflow.pioneerStack[0]) → resolveMissionRoute (missionReason) → buildMissionSystemContext + buildMissionMemoryContext → contextualHistory injection → execution`.
- Mission pioneer preference: `activeMission.workflow.pioneerStack[0]` → `preferredPioneerId` in routing.
- Mission context system message: identity (name, objective, scope, notThis, chamber, success criteria) + memory (last 4 continuity items for mission) — prepended to every message array sent to both Ollama and hosted endpoints.
- routeDigest when mission active: `[contract label] · [mission name] · [missionReason from resolveMissionRoute]`.

### Mission surface
- `dna/mission-substrate.ts` — Mission type: identity, workflow, memory, ledger, runtime, policy, artifacts.
- `MissionContextBand` — shell-wide strip with live pulse when executing, MISSION label, runCount, status, chamber, release.
- `MissionRepository` — full CRUD + activate in Profile > projects.
- `mcp-client.ts` — wired to Supabase edge function: create / get / list / updateState / attachContinuity / buildHandoff.
- Mission ID injected into every execution dispatch, governance gate, and continuity item.

### Chat surface
- `ChamberChat.tsx` — fully reconstituted: LiveHeaderRail (EI name + cycling ROUTING→ANALYZING→THINKING), ConsequenceTypeTag, MutableFooter, ProvenanceTrace (suppressed when ExecutionConsequenceStrip covers it), AgentLabel (role chip only — no manifesto).
- `ExecutionConsequenceStrip.tsx` — ALL-CAPS state labels; debug phases filtered; ROUTE badge on routeDigest.
- `GlobalExecutionBand.tsx` — bottom strip: eiName from leadPioneerId, chamber accent, live pulse.

### Terminal surface
- `RuberraTerminal.tsx` — fully reconstituted: command strip (chamber·model·mission·state), TerminalLayerBadge (TRACE/ARTIFACT/DIFF/RESULT/WARN/HANDOFF), layer inference on text blocks, mission-aware empty state.

### Governance
- `governance-fabric.ts` — `enforceExecutionGate()` active on every `chamber.*.dispatch`.
- `dna/trust-governance.ts` — audit trail appended per dispatch.
- `GovernanceLedgerStrip` mounted in ProfileMode > operations.

## ANTI-DRIFT SIGNALS

If you see any of these, something has drifted:
- A new surface that doesn't connect to a mission → `violates MOTHER_LAW.fragmentation_law`
- A "dashboard" with cards and progress bars → `drift signal: dashboard`
- An empty state with cheerful placeholder copy → `drift signal: theater`  
- A strip component that renders hardcoded data → `drift signal: fake data theater`
- A PR that skips stack order → `drift signal: stack order violation`
- An operation or task not bound to a mission → `drift signal: mission detachment`

## NEXT PIONEER ACTIONS

1. **Claude Architect** — Open Stack 6: Sovereign Security — identity boundaries, permission lattice, mission-level authorization enforcement.
2. **Copilot QA Guard** — Regression: Stack 5 close — terminal mission notice in all 3 chambers; SystemHealthBand "degraded" on mission block; ghost-safe activation verified.
3. **Grok Reality Pulse** — Audit Stack 5 for any fake/decorative adaptive behavior remaining. Confirm missionStatus flows correctly for all ledger transitions.
4. **Codex Systems** — Wire mission state advancement post-completion: after task_complete signal, evaluate if mission should auto-transition (Stack 6 dependency).
5. **Cursor Builder** — Stack 6 surface: security gate denial UI for mission-level authorization failures.
