# RUBERRA — STACK CLOSURE TRACKER

Purpose: close Ruberra in canonical stack order with one active frontier at a time.

## Execution Rule

- Only one stack may be `ACTIVE`.
- No stack can enter `ACTIVE` until all higher-priority stacks are `CLOSED`.
- Every stack must define: scope, deliverables, definition of done, and verification proof.

## Canonical Stack Closure Board

- `assertStackOrder()` — runtime guard preventing stack order violations.
- README correctly points to sovereign law docs.
- Drift signal registry live (`DRIFT_SIGNALS` in canon-sovereignty.ts).
- No conflicting framing present in root docs.

---

## Closed: Stack 2 (Mission Substrate)

### Exit Proof
- `dna/mission-substrate.ts` — Mission type: identity, workflow, memory, ledger, runtime, policy, artifacts.
- `MissionContextBand` — shell-wide strip: live pulse on execute, MISSION label, runCount, status, chamber, release.
- `MissionRepository` — CRUD + activate in Profile > projects.
- `mcp-client.ts` — Supabase edge function: create / get / list / updateState / attachContinuity / buildHandoff.
- `MissionOperationsPanel` — MOUNTED in ProfileMode > operations when activeMission set.
- `activeMissionOps` — state slot in App.tsx, initialized on mission activate/release.
- Mission ID injected into every execution dispatch, governance gate, and continuity item.
- CLOSED 2026-04-02

---

## Closed: Stack 3 (Sovereign Intelligence)

### Exit Proof
- `dna/sovereign-intelligence.ts` — MissionRouteRequest / MissionRouteResult / MemoryRecallRequest / MemoryRecallResult / MissionReasoningRequest / MissionReasoningResult typed.
- `resolveMissionRoute()` — called at every dispatch when mission active.
- `buildMissionSystemContext()` — mission identity injected as system[0] to both Ollama and hosted paths.
- `buildMissionMemoryContext()` — prior mission continuity items injected as mission memory context alongside identity.
- `preferredPioneerId` — `activeMission.workflow.pioneerStack[0]` honored in `resolveRouteDecision`.
- `routeDigest` — mission-bound when active: `[contract] · [mission name] · [missionReason]`.
- Intelligence serves mission state (identity + memory), not generic session.
- CLOSED 2026-04-02

---

## Closed: Stack 4 (Autonomous Operations)

### Exit Proof
Execution is governed by the operations substrate. MissionTask is a real lifecycle object. OperationFlow tracks the dispatch run. Approval gate is evaluated pre-dispatch. MissionSignal is emitted from runtime events, not post-hoc strings.

**Pre-dispatch (handleSend, App.tsx — after governance clears):**
- `createTask()` → `transitionTask("in_progress")` — task created BEFORE execution starts
- `createOperationFlow()` + `advanceFlow()` — OperationFlow created and advanced to "running" state
- `evaluateApprovalTrigger("external_effect", policy)` — approval gate evaluated when connectors are present; `escalate_sovereign` → `ApprovalRequest` created in `pendingApprovals`
- `generatedMissionTaskRef.current.add(assistantId)` — pre-marks message to prevent useEffect double-processing

**Post-dispatch (finally block, App.tsx):**
- `transitionTask(t, "completed" | "failed", { outputDigest })` — task lifecycle closed with real content digest
- `advanceFlow(advanceFlow(flow))` — Execute + Settle steps advanced → flow state "complete"
- `emitSignal(activeMissionId, { type: "task_complete", ... })` — MissionSignal emitted from real runtime event (not string residue)
- `RunObservation` appended with real pioneerId and content digest
- `buildOperationState()` recomputed from real task/observation arrays

**Secondary event-driven path (useEffect, App.tsx:1617-1718):**
- Monitors all chamber message arrays for terminal execution states not yet in `generatedMissionTaskRef`
- For each new terminal event: `createTask()` + `transitionTask()` + `RunObservation` + `emitSignal()` bound to active mission
- `generatedMissionTaskRef.current.add(ev.id)` — dedup guard prevents double-processing vs. primary pre/post-dispatch path
- `buildOperationState()` recomputed after all events processed
- REAL and EVENT-DRIVEN. Not decorative. This is the secondary substrate path for messages that did not originate in the primary handleSend flow.

**Mutation handlers (real, not stubs):**
- `handleMissionOpsSignalDismiss` — `dismissSignal()` mutates `activeMissionOps.signals`
- `handleMissionOpsApprovalApprove` / `handleMissionOpsApprovalReject` — moves approval from `pendingApprovals` to `approvalHistory`

## Closed: Stacks 12–14 (Purified 2026-04-03)

### Exit Proof
All three stacks were surgically audited and purged of substrate theater. They are now 100% runtime-real, driven by explicit persistence in `RuntimeFabric`.

**Stack 12 (Intelligence Analytics):**
- `detectPatterns()` ingests real signals, continuity, and mission ops events.
- `analyticsPatterns` persisted in `RuntimeFabric`.
- `AnalyticsPatternStrip` renders the result in ProfileMode.

**Stack 13 (Collective Execution):**
- `recordRuntimeAttribution()` called for all Creation completions.
- `ConsequenceAttribution` records accurately reflect operator + mission + continuity truth.
- `CollectiveExecutionStrip` surfaces these records live.

**Stack 14 (Distribution + Presence):**
- `heartbeatRuntimePresence()` + `updateRuntimePresence()` maintain live manifests.
- Channels (web, api, cli) derived from real message activity.
- `DistributionPresenceStrip` renders the result in ProfileBoard.

## Closed: Stack 5 (Adaptive Experience)

### Exit Proof
- `MissionContextBand` reads `activeMission.ledger.currentState` via `MISSION_STATUS_LABEL` + `STATUS_COLOR` — BLOCKED/COMPLETED/PAUSED/ARCHIVED surface with real color signals. REAL.
- `setMissionState("blocked")` in `system-awareness.ts` injects a `SystemAnomaly` (type: unexpected_state, severity: medium) into `systemModel.anomalies` and updates `health` → "degraded". `SystemHealthBand` renders organically. REAL.
- `setMissionState("idle"/"running")` resolves the mission-blocked anomaly — health recovers. REAL.
- Mission ledger → awareness sync effect: `useEffect` on `activeMission.ledger.currentState` calls `setMissionState("blocked"|"idle")` — ledger state changes propagate to SystemModel without dispatch cycle. REAL.
- Terminal mission dispatch gate in `handleSend`: if `activeMission.ledger.currentState === "completed" || "archived"`, emits a `recommendation` signal (severity: critical, destination: profile/projects) and returns. No execution proceeds. REAL.
- Ghost-safe activation: `handleMissionActivate` aborts all in-flight chamber requests via `abortRefs`, resets `loading` and `signals` before binding new mission. REAL.
- `ChamberChat` receives `missionStatus` prop. When terminal (completed/archived): consequence notice bar renders above composer; composer textarea is `disabled` with a locked placeholder. REAL.
- `missionStatus` prop threaded: `App.tsx` → `LabMode` / `SchoolMode` / `CreationMode` → `ChamberChat`. REAL.

### Exit Criteria
- [x] `MissionContextBand` state label updates to BLOCKED/COMPLETED/PAUSED reflect real `activeMission.ledger.currentState`
- [x] SystemHealthBand receives mission state signal on block/complete transitions
- [x] Chamber prompt area gives visual feedback when mission is in a terminal state (blocked/complete/archived)
- [x] No chamber enters a ghost state when mission is activated mid-session

## Closed: Stack 6 (Sovereign Security)

### Exit Proof
- `dna/sovereign-security.ts` — 8-layer security substrate: identity (OperatorSession), secrets (detectPlaintextSecret), access (evaluateAccess), isolation (verifyIsolation), connector (scanConnectorOutput), runtime (checkStorageSafety), recovery (RECOVERY_PLANS), event ledger (SecurityEvent + deriveTrustSignal).
- `SovereignSecurityState` instantiated in App.tsx as `securityState` state slot — single source of security truth.
- Operator session started on mount: `createSession(buildFingerprint())` — identity integrity substrate live.
- **Session fingerprint re-verified at every dispatch**: `verifyFingerprint(session, buildFingerprint())` — mismatch emits `session_anomaly` SecurityEvent (critical) before governance gate fires. QA gap closed 2026-04-02.
- Permission lattice enforced at dispatch: `evaluateAccess("mission_execute", pioneerId, defaultAccessPolicy(missionId))` — deny blocks execution + emits `scope_violation` SecurityEvent; require_approval emits warn SecurityEvent.
- Connector output scanned on every AI response: `scanConnectorOutput(assistantContent)` — injection/escalation/exfiltration → `injection_attempt` SecurityEvent → `updateTrustSignal()`.
- Storage safety checked periodically (60s): `checkStorageSafety(DEFAULT_RUNTIME_SAFETY_POLICY)` — overflow → `storage_overflow` SecurityEvent.
- `trustSignal` derived: `deriveTrustSignal(securityState.events)` — live, real, not hardcoded.
- `SecurityTrustSignal` in SovereignBar receives live `trustSignal` prop + `onSecurityAcknowledge` callback — silent when healthy, consequence signal when not.
- `handleSecurityAcknowledge` acknowledges all active events, re-derives signal.
- **governance-fabric.ts bug fixed**: `gate?.name` → `gate?.id ?? gate?.label` — TrustGate has no `.name` property; gateName and reason strings were always reporting "undefined". QA gap closed 2026-04-02.
- Build passes. Stacks 03/04/05 paths unchanged.
- `RUBERRA_TRUST_GATES` + `enforceExecutionGate()` remain live (governance-fabric.ts, unchanged).

### Exit Criteria
- [x] Identity boundaries materially enforced — operator session started, fingerprint-based identity integrity active
- [x] Session identity integrity enforced at dispatch — `verifyFingerprint()` called at every dispatch; mismatch → critical SecurityEvent
- [x] Permission lattice real and used — `evaluateAccess()` called at every mission dispatch
- [x] Mission-level authorization real — deny blocks execution; require_approval creates security event
- [x] High-impact actions cannot bypass — access check + governance gate run before dispatch proceeds; `evaluateApprovalTrigger()` for connector (external-effect) actions
- [x] SecurityTrustSignal reflects real trust/authz truth — `deriveTrustSignal(securityState.events)` drives the signal
- [x] Governance fabric stable — `enforceExecutionGate()` + audit trail real; gateName bug fixed
- [x] Stacks 03/04/05 remain stable — no changes to those paths
- [x] Build/runtime truth holds — clean build, no TypeScript errors

- `trustGovState` — persisted to localStorage; loaded on mount. Survives page reload.
- `GovernanceLedgerStrip` — receives live `governanceEntries` (audit trail) + `governanceConsequences` (consequence trail) from `trustGovState`. Both surfaces rendered in ProfileMode > operations.
- `enforceExecutionGate()` — governance policy gate fires at every dispatch, blocks or allows, result recorded in audit.
- Chain integrity: `verifyChainIntegrity()` available for audit probing.
- No phantom records. No decorative trust semantics. Consequence is real.

### Exit Criteria
- [x] Every dispatch has real audit entry — `appendAuditToLedger` at dispatch
- [x] Every export has real audit entry — `appendAuditToLedger` at export
- [x] Every dispatch completion has consequence record — `appendConsequenceToLedger` with reversible=false
- [x] Governance ledger visible in ProfileMode — GovernanceLedgerStrip with live audit + consequence trails
- [x] Governance state persisted — localStorage with JSON serialization
- [x] Policy enforcement real — `enforceExecutionGate()` at every dispatch

- CLOSED 2026-04-02

## Closed: Stack 8 (System Awareness)

### Exit Proof
- `dna/system-awareness.ts` — ResourceSnapshot, SystemAnomaly, SystemModel, detectAnomalies, deriveSystemHealth, updateSystemModel all real.
- `buildResourceSnapshot()` — called every 30s via setInterval. Captures JS heap, storage usage, latency, connections from real browser APIs.
- `updateSystemModel()` — detects anomalies from snapshot deltas: latency_spike, memory_pressure, storage_near_full, connection_drop.
- `setMissionState()` — called at dispatch start ("running"), completion ("idle"), block ("blocked"), abort ("idle"). Mission state anomalies propagate to SystemModel.
- `SystemHealthBand` — renders organically at shell level. Silent when healthy. Shows top anomaly + severity dot when degraded.
- **System health inspection surface** — `systemModel` passed to ProfileMode > overview. All unresolved anomalies visible with severity + description + snapshot timestamp. CLOSED 2026-04-02.
- No decorative monitoring chrome. Health is real because the system is real.

### Exit Criteria
- [x] Real resource snapshot every 30s — buildResourceSnapshot() via setInterval
- [x] Real anomaly detection from snapshot — latency, memory, storage, connection
- [x] Mission state anomalies propagate to system model — setMissionState at dispatch lifecycle
